## Description

This project will continuously be updated by members of my study group. We will pool our knowledge together to create a basic website. The name of the project is nerdog and will be used to guide our theme.

The main goal of this project is to help people practice git commands and add very small snippets of code to the project at a time. This is important as some members are not at the same level.

Please contribute ideas to the project.

Idea #1 - load pictures of smart dogs. Create small cards for them where their pictures will be displayed as well as their stats.

## Usage
